# Examiner

I created this application for the mock exams for Medical field students (especially for V), to practice their knowledge and help them in the upcoming board exams.

I chose examiner as the initial name of the projet referencing the street that I'm currently staying in Quezon City, Philippines. And also because this is a tool for examination.

# Changelogs:

**v1.0.2**

- Added the `a.txt` and `q.txt` files for the answers and questions respectively as reference for using the questions_data_formatter.sh script.

```bash
 ~/bash questions_data_formatter.sh <q.txt> <a.txt> <outputFilename(optional)>
```

**v1.0.1**

- Added the schema for the books and questions located in the `lib/utils/schema` directory.
- Moved from `npm` to `pnpm` as the main package manager.

# Issues:

**v1.0.2**

- Add support for optional question field for images and tables. (backtrack chapter 1 hematology, look for tables and pictures).
- Building the app only shows blank white screen.
