# Examiner

I created this application for the mock exams for Medical field students (especially for V), to practice their knowledge and help them in the upcoming board exams.

I chose examiner as the initial name of the projet referencing the street that I'm currently staying in Quezon City, Philippines. And also because this is a tool for examination.
