The most common treatment modality utilized in PV is phlebotomy. Reduction of blood volume (usually 1 unit of whole bloodâ€”450 cc) can be performed weekly or even twice weekly in younger patients to control symptoms. The Hct target range is less than 45% for men and less than 42% for women. IDA is a predictable complication of therapeutic phlebotomy because approximately 250 mg of iron is removed with each unit of blood.
